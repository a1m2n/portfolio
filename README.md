**Project Name: Mbebo’s Universe - A Personal Website Portfolio**

**Project Description:**

Mbebo’s Universe is a portfolio website designed with a space theme, inspired by the grandeur of the cosmos. The overall concept and theme revolve around creating a visually captivating and immersive experience for visitors, taking them on a journey through a virtual universe while showcasing creative portfolios. The users can control a 3D spacecraft model to land on a 3D planet that is rendered with the texture of a fictional planet. The 3D nature of the website together with the use of point and directional lighting makes the design look natural and immersive.

The goal is to provide a unique and memorable user experience that captures the imagination and curiosity of the visitors. By offering the  user control over the events in the website, the user is allowed to navigate the content as a traveler in a spaceship. The  control of the spaceship makes the experience almost feel like a game. By incorporating highly textured celestial bodies, starry backgrounds, and cosmic lighting, the website aims to evoke a sense of wonder and inspire creativity.

**Process:**

Concept: I started by brainstorming ideas for the portfolio website and I decided to go with a space theme because I wanted to express my personality through my love for space and gaming. After exploring several space related concepts, I decided to go with a single planet per window and have a directional light that represented the sun shine on one part of the planet. I also gathered visual references, including images of galaxies, nebulae, and planets, to help me create the unique space ambience.

**Design and Layout:** Once I had an general idea of what Ii wanted, I moved on to design a basic wireframe for the project. The focus was on creating a clean and intuitive design that allowed the interactions and user-experience to take the center stage. Space-themed illustrations, icons, and animations were incorporated to enhance the overall visual appeal.

**Development:** The development phase involved building the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Responsive design principles were followed to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. I used the WebGL model of p5js to create the spaceship and the planets. Each planet had a unique texture, position, and infoBox. By colliding with the planet, a infoBox unveils to show more about me. I used the p5js library and the Web Audio API for the audio. I changed the cursor icon in the canvas to a space shuttle icon.

The audio file plays the info on the home page when the spacecraft lands on the first planet. There is also cool background music that plays when you visit the planet. Special attention was given to optimizing the performance and loading times to provide a smooth browsing experience.

**Content Integration:** I integrated content and projects that we had done throughout this course and included links to access them. I also included a portion for my skills and achievements.

**Testing and Refinement**: Extensive testing was conducted to identify and resolve any issues or bugs. Errors with webGL took longer than expected to resolve as this was my first experience with it.

**Reflection/Evaluation:**

The development of Mbebo’s universe successfully achieved the envisioned space-themed experience. The website's design and layout effectively conveyed the awe-inspiring nature of the cosmos, providing visitors with a visually stimulating and immersive journey.

The incorporation of space-themed illustrations, animations, and interactive elements captivated the attention of users and created a memorable impression.

I had a lot of fun using the Webgl model as it completely changed my perception for 2d websites. I learnt a lot from this project and I can't wait to develop the website further to create  a more immersive  experience.

Mbebo’s Universe was built from scratch without online templates and this is testament of the power of creativity and innovation in web design, demonstrating how a unique concept and theme can elevate a portfolio website and create a lasting impact on visitors.
